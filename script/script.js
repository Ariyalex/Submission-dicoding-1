                            Pendragon/King Arthur. In history, he/she is a different figure that may not have been known
                            to others as possibly being the legendary King Arthur himself. Accompanied with her
                            inversion, the holy sword Excalibur is also dyed in the attribute of evil, turning into a
                            jet black sword. It seems that Excalibur, a sword gifted from the fairies, has the
                            possibility of possessing both attributes of good and evil as well; there exists Vivian, the
                            Fairy of the Lake who possesses the attribute of good, and Morgan, who exists as the
                            antithesis to Vivian that possesses the attribute of evil. In addition, in Artoria Alter's
                            Fate/Grand Order Interlude Vortigern, who was criticized as the "look-alike of Vortigern,
                            the late Vile King of ancient times" from a certain person (Servant), was a figure who
                            usurped the throne of Britain and was the older brother of King Uther, the father of
                            Arthur.`,

        content: `A different aspect of the King of Knights devoted to cruelty, greatly unlike the case of the
                            normal Artoria. She is referred to as Saber Alter. A behavior without futility, a
                            cold-hearted personality that makes Artoria seem like a different person, but if one is to
                            carefully come into contact with her, they might notice that what lies at the basis is still
                            the same.
                            <br><br>
                            Artoria Alter's personality changes vastly from her normal self upon being corrupted by
                            Angra Mainyu, but she cannot be called a villain. She is more of a dark hero who is still an
                            idealist clinging to her own values even after being blackened.
                            <br><br>
                            After taking in by the hatred of the curse, <span class="bold">Artoria Alter</span> comes to the realization that the
                            duty of a hero is to be hated and ostracized, that a hero's only duty is to cut down foes
                            using all their strength. She believes that she was prepared for such an outcome upon
                            drawing Caliburn, and decides to entrust her blade to All the World's Evils. While she still
                            takes her duty as king seriously, believing it is her obligation to those whose lives were
                            lost because of her, she no longer believes in the ideals set for herself and her people.
                            The end was concluded long ago, after all her prayers and glory vanished on the hill in
                            CamlannWP.
                            <br><br>
                            While alive, Artoria did not fall into the path of evil even once, but she too had doubts,
                            inner conflicts, hatred towards herself and grief towards the surroundings. This figure,
                            influenced by the curse of the Holy Grail, is someone that had such issues hidden within her
                            raised to the surface and caused her "policy" to go inverse.
                            <br><br>
                            Because a section of her character's attributes has been inverted, the basis of Artoria
                            Alter's character speak words and display deeds like those of a "tyrant's", which is the
                            exact opposite of her usual character, but there is no change in her goals and ideals
                            themselves, and it seems she shows a bit of her original self as her feelings towards the
                            people who are close to her have been left behind and intact, although barely. The
                            usual Artoria persisted in being chaste for the sake of her ideals, but this Artoria
                            approves tyrannical rule for the sake of her ideals.
                            <br><br>
                            Having been violated by the curse of the Holy Grail, this is a side of the King of Knights,
                            a tyrant that persisted in being heartless. Maybe, the "ideal king" that King Arthur pursued
                            was something like this after all.
                            <br><br>
                            Maybe because her Magic Core goes outside the scale, but at any rate, <span class="bold">Artoria Alter</span> is a
                            Servant that eats a lot. The dragon is a glutton. In addition, even her food preferences,
                            which could be regarded as her identity, have changed: she spits out cooking with courteous,
                            elaborate, abstruse tastes as bad and chews down large quantities of junk food. A new
                            identity for Artoria who came into contact with the foundation of foreign cultures, as if
                            food culture has become a Heroic Spirit. Concerning her who has an evil heart that is
                            outside of the norm, meals become nothing but refreshing fuel, and it seems the manner of
                            being able to eat food in a simple way is desirable for her. Awful eating habits, but she
                            herself seems greatly satisfied, so maybe this can be called a form of happiness.
                            <br><br>
                            Concerning her motive on what to wish for on the Holy Grail and what rouses her to pursue
                            it, it is no different from Artoria's. However, affirming her strength to the point of
                            committing atrocities, she not only responds to the desires of a Master wishing for a strong
                            Servant because of their objective to fight and save the world, but she responds to also do
                            battle against the Master's more repulsive enemies and the more powerful adversaries, as
                            well as to train the Master in improving their skills. Her methods surely differs, but her
                            approach to guiding and understanding the Master is certainly Artoria Pendragon's. In
                            addition, in the world of Fate/Grand Order, her existence as a Servant is separate from
                            Artoria Pendragon's, and Artoria is no longer consumed by the blackening caused by the curse
                            of the Holy Grail. Probably due to the fact that <span class="bold">Artoria Alter</span> only exist in the Heaven's
                            Feel timeline where Shirou chooses Sakura and that Artoria herself has already ascended to
                            Avalon during the Fate timeline which was confirmed by Merlin himself.
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="bold">Artoria Alter</span> is mostly emotionless towards the situation of Shirou, Rin, and Sakura. While
                            she seems to hold favor for Shirou and Rin coming out victorious, she is largely apathetic
                            towards the entire situation. In the case of the battle going wrong, she doesn't care about
                            the victor and can only hold a slight amount of pity towards those left alive. She feels a
                            connection to Sakura as someone who has felt similar despair.`

        content: `After being blackened, <span class="bold">Artoria Alter</span> magic reactor grew outside the scale, greatly increasing her
                            Magical Energy consumption. However, thanks to being Sakura's Servant, she was provided
                            with her enormous magical energy supply. Whereas Artoria used to contain her own
                            power, due to her past Masters usually being unable to provide her with sufficient
                            Magical Energy, in this condition, she wields powerful energy without hesitation. As
                            such, her destructive power has also been increased, becoming a fearful being, inflicting
                            havoc and death upon the world. Although Artoria was able to make use of her original
                            abilities without being affected by the Master after making a contract with Rin, and
                            just seeing her standing in that state without moving a single finger was enough to make
                            Shirou believe that there seemed to be no end to her overwhelming power and that she
                            wouldn't lose even to Heracles, in a sense, Saber Alter is even more powerful than she
                            was in life, and none can deny that she is the strongest servant. In straightforward
                            attack power, she is the strongest.`,

        title: "NOBLE PHANTASM",
        id: "noble_phantasm",
        content: `In this form, Artoria still wields Excalibur. Due to the nature of this Divine Construct as
                            a “sword that amplifies”, when Saber was blackened, Excalibur blackened with her, becoming
                            known as <span class="bold">Excalibur Morgan</span>. In this state, the fact that it is the strongest holy sword does
                            not change, and it can be considered even more dangerous than its regular counterpart due to
                            Artoria wielding it to her heart's content, without controlling her own magical energy. As
                            such, to beat Saber Alter in a one on one duel, her opponent would need to be a skilled user
                            of a Noble Phantasm that equals hers. A contradiction, since very few Heroic Spirits may
                            possess a Noble Phantasm surpassing hers. Furthermore, thanks to the enormous mana supply
                            granted by Sakura, Artoria can now invoke this Noble Phantasm without limit.<br><br>
                            Thanks to this, after Saber was blackened in the Fuyuki Singularity, she began rampaging
                            like a tiger released from a cage, defeating EMIYA, Benkei, Medusa, Heracles and Hassan of
                            the Cursed Arm by herself.<br><br>
                            In her fight against Medusa, <span class="bold">Excalibur Morgan</span> managed to offset ninety percent of
                            Bellerophon in less than an instant, despite Medusa's Mystic Eyes producing a rank down on
                            all of Artoria's abilities. Saber's holy sword would normally have no trouble vaporizing
                            Medusa's trump card, however, Shirou was able to aid her by making up for the difference
                            with Rho Aias, barely gaining an edge in the confrontation of the Noble Phantasms. Thanks to
                            their combined efforts, Saber was left deeply wounded, however, she still had some power
                            left, and had Shirou not killed her right there with the Azoth Sword, Saber would have
                            healed short after.<br><br>
                            In her fight against Caster Cú Chulainn and Mash, Saber Alter lost due to her tenacity
                            wavering. Since she stayed her hand at the last moment right before firing her Noble
                            Phantasm, Mash managed to block it with Lord Chaldeas allowing Cú to finish Saber off with
                            Wicker Man. Even in this weakened state, <span class="bold">Excalibur Morgan</span> remains extremely powerful, as
                            even after Altera absorbed a Holy Grail in the Septem Singularity and fired her Teardrop
                            Photon Ray, its tremendous magical energy only reminded Mash of the sacred sword they saw in
                            Fuyuki. Mash also stated that Lord Chaldeas wouldn't have been able to block it on its own,
                            as she needed the help of Boudica's own Noble Phantasm to block it, and even then, Lu Bu and
                            Spartacus were destroyed by the light since they were rampaging around the palace
                            entrance.<br><br>
                            She would go on to doubt if Nero Claudius, Boudica and herself would be enough to beat
                            Altera since she had help of a powerful Caster when they defeated Saber Alter. Although
                            Saber Alter considers Altera herself to be a disappointment, once Altera starts drawing all
                            the mana in the atmosphere into her blade, Artoria acknowledges her Teardrop Photon Ray as a
                            worthy foe. Despite that Noble Phantasm being capable of incinerating the world, Excalibur
                            Morgan overpowers it, annihilating Altera.<br><br>
                            Although Saber Alter boasts an unbelievable magical output, Dr. Roman measures that the
                            power output demonstrated by the Lion King when they first saw her in the Camelot
                            Singularity is way beyond anything seen previously from Saber Alter.<br><br>
                            Wielding the most famous Holy Sword doesn't come without a disadvantage. Due to being the
                            most famous holy sword in the modern era, anyone who gets hit by her Noble Phantasm and
                            survives it will find out her True Name. Thus, it will allow her opponent to come up with a
                            better strategy next time they face each other.<br><br>
                            In this state, Artoria doesn't even try to search for an utopia but instead pursues a more
                            realistic common ground, understanding that no matter how much she pursues her ideals, all
                            humans will eventually die in a meaningless way. As such, in the hypothetical case that
                            Shirou gave Avalon to Saber Alter, she wouldn't be able to use it.<br><br>`,
